# Visual C++ Project Compare v1.0 Released

I've finally got around to releasing v1.0 of my tool for comparing Visual C++ project files to highlight inconsistencies in the settings between builds or other related projects. It's been in Beta since Xmas last year and the only change was to add the missing <Configuration> <configuration>attributes to the comparison as it didn't show up mismatched "CharacterSet" settings for example.</configuration>

The Release and Debug versions are already available and the source code will be released in a few days. The packages along with a screenshot and the manual are on my web site [here](http://www.cix.co.uk/~gort/win32.htm#VCProjCompare) in the Win32 section.
